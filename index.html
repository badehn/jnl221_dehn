		<p>In my DataWrapper chart, I compared the total snowfall per season in Buffalo, NY and the total amount of wins by the Buffalo Bills each season in a very simple bar chart. In my creative dataviz, I maintained the same concept of comparing those two numbers on a bar chart, but on a bar chart that looked like a football field. </p>
		<p>One thing I may change going forward with my creative dataviz would simply be stylistic changes such as colors or details that don't alter the overall presentation of the data such as including the Buffalo Bills logo on the field. If I were to edit my DataWrapper chart again I would spend some time trying to figure out why it split the year columns in the early 2000's and put them at opposite ends of the chart. One thing I know I will change regardless across both charts is that I will need to find a way to present such a large amount of data in a more condensed way as it is a little hard to look at such a large chart. </p>
