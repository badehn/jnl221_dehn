<h1>Mike Harrington: How much can the Sabres ride Devon Levi in goal this week? As much as he can play.</h1>
	<h2>Mike Harrington writes a lot of things that I don't understand because I am not into hockey like that. Probably talks about how the Sabres suck though.</h2>

<!-- IDK why, probably because it is Easter and I am burnt out from being with my family since Thursday, but all I can do is stare at #7... not even blinking. --> 

<p>Devon Levi is 21 years old going on 41, so the Buffalo Sabres have developed trust in him in stunningly quick fashion.</p>
<p>But after the chaos of Thursday's wild shootout win in Detroit, was he going to come back Saturday against a much better opponent just over 36 hours later?</p>
<p>You bet. And Levi's showing in the win over Carolina says volumes about what the Sabres are thinking.</p><div>
